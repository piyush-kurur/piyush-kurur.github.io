\title{Performance of Metropolis Algorithm for the Minimum Weight Codeword Problem}
\begin{document}
\maketitle 

We study the performance of the Metropolis algorithm for the problem
of finding a code word of weight less than or equal to $\ell$, given a
generator matrix of a binary linear code. The algorithm uses as its
search space, the set of all generator matrices of the code. Let
$\mathrm{wt}(g)$ denote the Hamming weight of a code word $g$. We use
the following cost function: the cost $c(G)$ associated with the
generator matrix $G$ is the minimum of $\mathrm{wt}(g)^\alpha$, where
$g$ varies over the rows of $G$ and $\alpha$ is a positive constant.
We prove that the associated Markov chains mix rapidly for
temperatures $T$ greater than or equal to $n^\alpha$, where $n$ is the
block length. Therefore, the algorithm will find a code word of length
less that $\ell$ if the probability $p_\ell$ of such a code word is
high in the stationary distribution. Since a good bound for $p_\ell$
is difficult to estimate, to understand the algorithm's performance,
we experiment with various settings of the temperature parameter $T$
and the exponent $\alpha$ in the cost function, for certain BCH codes
and full dimensional codes. The Metropolis algorithm performed very
well in comparison to previously known experimental results which had
used certain other search heuristics.
