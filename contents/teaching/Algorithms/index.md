# Registration under the old scheme.

Students who are registering for this course under the old scheme,
please make sure that you course code is CS345 as opposed to
CS345A. The online registration system did not have such an entry
before. I am told that CS345 has now been added but in case of trouble
please do a manual registration.

# Major and Minor in CS

Students who are planning to take Algorithms as part of their
major/minor in CS please do manual registration during the add-drop
phase. Remember that you should have done Data structures as it is a
pre-requisite for this course.
