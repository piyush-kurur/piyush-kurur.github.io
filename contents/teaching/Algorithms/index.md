# Blogs and other stuff

1. [Russel O'Connor](http://r6.ca) in his blog post titled
   ["A Very general method of computing shortest path"][short] has
   given an actual implementation of the abstract version of the shortest
   path algorithm in [Haskell]. You can understand most of it even if you
   do not understand [Haskell]
