active: Teaching
---
This course deals with algorithmic aspects of computational algebra.
The topics that are to be covered would be

1. Modular algorithms
2. Factoring polynomials of finite fields and rationals
3. Bivariate factoring
4. Algorithms from number theory: primality testing, factoring integers
5. Fast arithmetic
6. Applications: Coding theory, cryptography etc.

We will have additional topics if time permits.
