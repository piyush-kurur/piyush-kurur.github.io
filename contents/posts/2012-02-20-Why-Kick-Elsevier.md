title: Why kick Elsevier?

This is my understanding of the issue. You are free to send me any
correction.

## Economic damage

1. High cost of journal subscription. Journals of Elsevier are too
   costly. What is worse is that they have taken over other journals
   and currently have a huge monopoly.

2. Bundling journals. Libraries have to subscribe to a bundle to
   get a few journals of interest. Often bundles contain journals that
   are not of any interest to a particular institution. Worse, they
   include journals which themselves are questionable: e.g. journals
   like Chaos, Soliton and fractals.

## Unethical publishing practice

1. Reviewing, which is important scientific responsibility of any
   journals, have been a sham in many cases.  For example, Journals
   like Chaos, Soliton and fractals have published 302 papers from
   their Editor-in-chief El Naschie. (See
   <http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mohamed_El_Naschie>)

2. Setting up journals on pseudo-sciences like for e.g. The Homeopathy
   (No link given so that they don't get the benefit of page ranking)
   which give them unnecessary scientific credibility. Astrologers,
   What are you waiting for? Call Elsevier right now.

3. There has been cases of Elsevier publishing many fake papers
   written by ghost writers in return to getting paid by drug
   companies. See for example

      * [The Scientist article on Merck affair][merck affair]
      * [They do it again][cbsnews]

4. Reed Elsevier's role in arms trade (See
   <http://www.idiolect.org.uk/elsevier/>) While an action that is
   difficult to justify, I would not consider this hurting the
   scientific publishing directly (other than the *minor* danger of
   completely wiping out humanity and thus the scientific
   establishment, at least on earth). With pressure mounting,
   apparently they have given up on this illustrious business.

Summarising, the business practice of Elsevier has hurt scientific
foundation not only economically but also led to lose of scientific
credibility due to the questionable publishing standards they have
followed.

# What can we do ?

1. Boycott them. See <http://thecostofknowledge.com>.

2. If you are an editor of an Elsevier journal, resign now and
   encourage your fellow editors to resign en masse. See

      * [*Journal of Algorithms* editorial board resignation][jalg]
      * [Resignation of the editorial board of *Topology*][topology]

3. If you happen to be in the library committee of your institute try
   to get Elsevier out of the subscription list.

4. Support and form journals like [*Theory of
   Computing*][toc]

5. Make all your work available on the net.

Remember all of this is not without ``risks''. So evaluate the best
options for you and make up your mind.
