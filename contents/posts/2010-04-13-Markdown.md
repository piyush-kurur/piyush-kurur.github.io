title: Markdown: or how I stopped hating html and started liking homepage creation
tags: Web

It was hate at first sight. I remember quite well my first encounter
with [html]. It was way back in the previous century (somewhere around
1997-98) when I first saw an actual [html] page. It looked uglier than
the *DO 10 CONTINUE* lines of Fortran 77 that we were forced to use as
part of our B.Tech "Learn how to use a computer" course. Many of my
friends considered this Fortran course as part of the "Ragging" that
one has to endure to become Engineers. But I am sure when they started
their webpage creating phase of life they would have come for an even
bigger shock. To put it politely: [html] is an ugly format that has
caused more miseries to humanity than all the world's religions put
together.

The popularity of [html] is baffling. It is not the most efficient of
the formats from the rendering point of view and definitely not a
format for mere mortals.  The kludge called [html] also brought about
an industry of WYSIWYG [html] editors which really spits venom when
asked to render a Hello world page. This has lead to many "Best view
by .... under 1024 x 798 resolution" pages; so much for the
"portability" of [html].  Despite all these shortcomings [html] became
popular. What more its "success" as a text format lead people to the
creation of even uglier cousins like [XML].

In this difficult world I had to make my homepage. Having a homepage
is important in today's world, they say. It is important to have your
papers online, for example, in the unlikely event that some one is
interested in your work. But the ugliness of [html] was unbearable.  I
searched far and low for other ways to create [html] including
[LaTeX2HTML]. All had their drawbacks.

Enter [Markdown]. This really changed my life as far as webpage
creation is concerned. Here is a format that one can easily convert to
[html] and is as pleasing to write as an anonymous hate mail to your
boss ([markdown]'s format is based on email conventions). To convert
markdown to html one just uses the [markdown.pl] script. However my
favourite converter is the swiss army knife for format conversion
[pandoc]. [Pandoc] is a program that can inter convert between various
text formats much like the [convert] for image formats. This means
that if you already have an existing homepage you can use [pandoc] to
first convert it into [markdown], edit it and then reconvert to
[html]. Pandoc also supports much needed extensions like the inline
math a la LaTeX, a horror if one has to do it using [MathML].

[Pandoc] is not just a text format converter. It comes with a
supporting [Haskell] library which can be used to program specialised
converters if needed.
