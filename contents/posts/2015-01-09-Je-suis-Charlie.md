title: Je suis Charlie
---

Je parle un peu fran√ßais mais had never heard of
[Charlie Hebdo][charlie] before. I probably do not subscribe to your
political views (I do not know). But there is one thing that I
support: making the world a better place by reducing the influence of
the arrogant religions of the world.

For too long they have been pampered with

1. the unquestioned right to take offence and vandalise,

2. the unquestioned right to spread their superstitions, despite
   modern science poking holes into all their theories about the universe.

3. the unquestioned right to pretend that they are the sole authority when
   it comes to goodness and ethics,

4. the unquestioned right to tax breaks.

Not any more. Donc ["Je suis Charlie"][charlie]
