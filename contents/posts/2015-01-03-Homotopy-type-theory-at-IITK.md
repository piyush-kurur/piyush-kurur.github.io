[Steve Awodey] is going to talk about [homotopy type theory][hott] at
our department on 14th of January, 2015 at 3:00pm. This will be the
6th Hari V Sahasrabuddhe [*Inflections in Computing*][hvs-lecture]
lecture. The abstract is given below.

> *Homotopy type theory* is a homotopical interpretation of a system of
> constructive type theory.  It provides a new framework for the
> foundations of mathematics with intrinsic geometric content and a
> computational implementation.  It is currently under intense
> development by logicians, mathematicians and computer scientists as
> a potential tool for both the large-scale formalization and
> verification of mathematical proofs and formal verification of
> software.  In this survey talk, I will introduce this system and
> show how it can be used to give new logical proofs of some classical
> theorems from algebraic topology, making use of the new ideas of
> higher inductive types and the univalence axiom.
