This blog does not support comments. The reasons are the following

1. This is a static using no dynamic PHP or any such monstrosities. I
   could have something like [Disqus].

2. I am already full with spams in my inbox and do not have the
   motivation like others to weed out the spam.

However if you are motivated, and feel that
[some one is wrong on the internet][xkcd-duty-calls], then you can
send your comments to me via email. I hope to make the source code of
this site open to all. Once that happens you can also send patches to
me which will be incorporated.

**Update 28 May 2013:** The entire hakyll source is available at
~~~<http://hub.darcs.net/ppk/website>~~~ <http://github.com/piyush-kurur-pages/website>

**Update 03 Oct 2013:** Now uses disqus for commenting.

[disqus]: <http://disqus.com>
[xkcd-duty-calls]: <http://xkcd.com/386> "Duty Calls"
