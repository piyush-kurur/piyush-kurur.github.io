# Before emailing me.

Email is the prefered means of contacting me. However, take a few
seconds to read the following before hitting the the send button.

1. No unsolicited emails. In particular, please do not invite me to
   join facebook, linkedin or whatever is the latest madness.  I have
   *no interest* even if you are [wikipedia:Amitabh Bachan]()

2. Make sure you emails have valid from/reply-to and subject
   fields. Subjects should be brief. Students doing a course with me
   please mention the course number in the subject. Examples below.

~~~ {.bash }

   [cs682] Mistake in midsem marks.
   [cs350] Doubts in the last lecture.

~~~

3. Follow basic email etiquette: as far as possible plain text mails
   and definitely not doc files, use inline style and no thread
   hijacking
