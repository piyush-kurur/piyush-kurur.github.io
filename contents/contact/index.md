# Before emailing me.

Email is the preferred means of contacting me. However, take a few
seconds to read the following before hitting the the send button.

1. No unsolicited emails. In particular, please do not invite me to
   join facebook, linkedin or whatever is the latest madness.  I have
   *no interest* even if you are [wikipedia:Amitabh Bachan]()

2. Editors of Elsevier Journals, please *do not* send me referee
   requests. I have pledged to [boycott Elsevier][whykick] and you
   might also want to join it at <http://thecostofknowledge.com>.

3. Make sure you emails have valid from/reply-to and subject
   fields. Subjects should be brief. Students doing a course with me
   please mention the course number in the subject. Examples below.

~~~ {.bash }

   [cs682] Mistake in midsem marks.
   [cs350] Doubts in the last lecture.

~~~

4. Follow basic email etiquette: as far as possible please send only
*plain text mails* and definitely not doc files. When replying please
use *[wikipedia:Posting style#Interleaved style|inline style]()*. Also
do not hijack threads by replying to old mails with subjects changed.
Compose a new mail instead. Mail clients (except some stupid ones like
the gmail webclient) figures out threads by looking at `In-Reply-To`
field so your email then gets connected to a different thread.
