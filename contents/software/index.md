This pages lists some software that I wrote. Most of it is in public
domain or is released under a free license (GPL/BSD). So feel free to
use it.


1. Cryptographic network library [Raaz].

2. [Indentparser], a library to build parsec parsers for indentation
  based syntax.

3. Managing servers keys ([make-ssl-server]) and server CA
   ([make-ssl-server-ca]) via Makefiles and [openssl]
