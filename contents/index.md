# About me

I work at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering][cse],
[IIT Kanpur][iitk]. I try to make sense of the complex world around us
through the tools of computer science: algorithms, complexity and
logic.


Check the [quantum computing course page][quantum computing] for the
details of my course next semester
